The lib/ directory contains Scheme code for various extensions to
the standard Larceny system.  

These descriptions provide the intended purpose and invariants for
each directory.

lib/Base/       : Miscellaneous code.  Each file is integrated into at
                  least one heap included with the standard
                  distribution.  Does not depend on files in other
                  parts of the lib/ hierarchy.  Every file is portable across
                  target operating systems.

lib/Debugger/   : Debugging, tracing, and profiling tools.  Some files 
                  are included in heaps in the standard distribution.
                  Dependent on the representation of continuation 
                  frames (standard across all Larceny variants), 
                  but otherwise portable.

lib/R6RS        : ERR5RS/R6RS libraries and supporting code.  Used
                  only by ERR5RS/R6RS modes.  Does not depend on
                  other parts of the lib/ hierarchy, except perhaps
                  some parts of lib/Base that are part of standard
                  heaps.

lib/SRFI/        : Scheme Request For Implementation (SRFI) libraries.
                  Depends on things provided elsewhere in the lib/
                  hierarchy.

lib/Standard/   : Miscellaneous code.  No file is included in any
                  heap in the standard distribution.  Depends on
                  things provided elsewhere in the lib/ hierarchy.
                  Some files only work on certain systems.

lib/Ffi/        : FFI code (Petit and native Larceny).  Files may be
                  built into distributed heaps.  Dependent on many
                  aspects of the runtime, operating system, and
                  compiler.

lib/TeachPacks/ : Support files for teachpacks compatible with "How To
                  Design Programs" (HtDP).


----

The directories below are not supported as well as the ones above.

lib/MzScheme/   : MzScheme compatibilty layer for Common Larceny.
                  (Also contains FFI code for Common Larceny,
                  unfortunately.)

lib/Experimental/ : Staging area for experimental libraries.
