; SRFI 61: a more general cond clause

; The following reference implementation, written by Taylor Campbell,
; is in the public domain.

; The entirety of a syntax transformer for the new cond syntax is
; given here.  It uses an auxiliary macro, cond/maybe-more, to
; simplify the construction of if expressions with or without more
; cond clauses.  The code is in the public domain.

(define-syntax cond
  (syntax-rules (=> else)

    ((cond (else else1 else2 ...))

     ;; The (IF #T (BEGIN ...)) wrapper ensures that there may be no
     ;; internal definitions in the body of the clause.  R5RS mandates
     ;; this in text (by referring to each subform of the clauses as
     ;; <expression>) but not in its reference implementation of COND,
     ;; which just expands to (BEGIN ...) with no (IF #T ...) wrapper.

     (if #t (begin else1 else2 ...)))
