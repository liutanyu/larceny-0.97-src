Tests for the SRFI implementations.

To run the tests, just load the test programs into Larceny.  (If you
have not set up Larceny to load SRFI-0 on startup, you must load it
manually before loading the tests.  Try evaluating
    (require 'srfi-0)
for example.)

There are occasionally interactions between the test programs: SRFI-5
redefines LET, some SRFIs require yet others to be precent (eg, SRFI-1
requires SRFI-8), and some SRFIs redefine identifiers defined in
others (eg FORMAT).  Thorough testing probably requires loading each
test into a clean system to avoid interactions.
