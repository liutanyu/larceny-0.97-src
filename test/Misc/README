Random tests that do not fit elsewhere.

env-tests.sch: tests how syntactic environments and compiler macros
are used in a production heap (produced by Util/std-heap.sch).

nucleic2.sch: just a stress test, as far as I can tell.  Could probably
go into ../Stress/scm/, but there is already a nucleic.scm there.  The
two versions appear to be different, but I have not looked closely at
what the differences are.  

See comments in files for how to run.
