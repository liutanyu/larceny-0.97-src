This directory contains the core runtime for Common Larceny.
(That is, it contains (almost?) all code that isn't written
in Scheme or generated dynamically by Scheme code.)

Constants.cs is autogenerated from .cfg files, and should not
be edited directly.

SchemeObject.cs is auto-generated from SchemeObject.cs.cpp,
and should not be edited directly.  Edit one or more of the
*.inc files instead.

For information on adding new primops, see Ops_SObject.inc

The main entry point is in Load.cs

To change the version number, edit both AssemblyInfo.cs and
Syscall.cs.
