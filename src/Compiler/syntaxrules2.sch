; Optimizer for a <transformer spec>.
;
; The representations of macro denotations and compiled rules
; are described in syntaxenv.sch and syntaxrules.sch.  For an
; unoptimized macro denotation, the macro expander just tries
; all of the rules in order.
;
; If there are a lot of rules, that takes a long time.
; The optimizer in this file tries to add a special-purpose
; hash function and hashed rules table to macro denotations.
;
; FIXME:  This optimizer is woefully special-purpose.
;
; Pattern optimization is an interesting problem in general,
; but this optimizer was added to handle patterns of the form
;
;     (<symbol> <symbol> P)
;
; where the symbols have their usual identifier denotation
; in the environment of definition.
