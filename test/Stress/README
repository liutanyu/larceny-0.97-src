Setup
-----
The bench shell script must be run from this directory.  When it is run,
there must be a link in the directory to an executable 'larceny' and
links to two heap images: 'r5rs.heap' should be the basic heap image,
and 'twobit.heap' should be the twobit heap image.

Running
-------
To run, say:
	./bench larceny all

If the purpose of the run is to test performance, then
 - larceny.heap should have been initialized, re-dumped and treated 
   with -reorganize-and-dump
 - all files should reside on a local file system


Summarizing
-----------
To summarize results, load summarize.sch into a Scheme system and then
run

	((summarize larceny-results) "results.Larceny")

Note that successive runs of bench append the output to results.Larceny.
