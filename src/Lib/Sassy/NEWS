New in Version 0.2
==================

* 16 bit support using 32-bit addressing syntax

* New form: Local labels support/declarations
  (locals (<label-name> ...) <item> ...)

* Syntax change: all label definitions are now written
  (label <name> <item> ...)

* Syntax change: For consistency, the "direcs" directive has been
  replaced by "begin". "begin" is now usable in data and heap
  directives.

* Support for Guile 1.8

* Support for Scheme48 module interfaces

* sassy-mode minor Emacs mode (sassy.el)

* Segment Override prefixes and branch hinting prefixes

* Better handling of default operand sizes, optimizing generated code
  sequences for size.

* New version of sassy-make-bin (includes a data section now)

* Fixes for with-win with-lose with-win-lose, so that writing assembly
  in a, umm, "natural" cps style is possible.

* Numerous bug fixes, clean-ups, and more error checks.
