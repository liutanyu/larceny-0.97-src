; To run this test program:
;  - make sure that Larceny's scheme-srfi-7 program is in your path
;  - make sure this script has execute permissions set
;
; Then CD to some other directory than the one containing the present
; file (for example the parent directory), and invoke this file as a
; program with some arguments:
;
;    test/srfi-22-test foo bar baz
;
; The program should print some test results, followed by "Done.", and
; then exit to the shell with code 13.  (In bash, at least, you can
; check the code by "echo $PIPESTATUS".)
