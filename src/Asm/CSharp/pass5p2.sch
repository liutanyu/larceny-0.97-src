;; OVERVIEW

;; ** INPUT **

;; When code from a Scheme file being compiled reaches this point, it 
;; is represented in the following form:

;; A file consists of a sequence of top-level expressions. Each top-level 
;; expression is represented by a list of MacScheme instructions, consisting
;; of an operation and the operands it requires.

;; An instruction is:
;;  - ($constant vector)
;;  - ($global symbol)
;;  - ($setglbl symbol)
;;  - ($lambda (listof instruction) number vector)
;;  - ($.label number)
;;  - a boring-instruction (which has no interesting structure)

;; In the case of $constant, $global, and $setglbl, the operand is a constant.
;; A new slot is allocated in the current constant vector for the operand. The 
;; code emitted for the instruction will refer to the constant by its offset 
;; in the constant vector. (In some cases (eg, immediates, fixnums) the slot 
;; allocation may be avoided.)

;; $lambda indicates the start of a new, nested codevector. It has separate 
;; labels, and it has its own constant vector. The nested codevector (sequence
;; of instructions) is processed, and the resulting codevector representation 
;; and its constant vector are placed in the next two slots of the constant 
;; vector of the instruction sequence corresponding to the $lambda instruction.
;; Thus the code emitted by this phase is not emitted in a linear fashion, but
;; as trees contained within the top-level constant vectors. The task of 
;; flattening this tree is handled in dumpheap-extra.sch.

;; $.label indicates the start of a new basic block. Labels are unique within
;; a code vector, but are not unique in larger scopes. (Aside: is this
;; strictly a basic block? Don't we have jumps out of middle?)

;; The other instructions do not have complex structure, and they have little
;; implications for the structure of generated code.

;; ** OUTPUT **

;; A procedure is represented by an instance of the Procedure class, which 
;; contains a CodeVector, a constant vector (as a SchemeObject), and an 
;; environment rib. The top-level expressions are compiled into a class with 
;; two static members containing the codevector and constant vector. At
;; "load-time", a procedure is created with these two components and invoked.

;; A codevector is represented as a singleton class (private constructor, 
;; single instance in a static field) which contains a single method (an 
;; instance method): void call(int).  The call() method 
;; contains the code emitted for that codevector's instructions. The int 
;; argument is the label of the basic block with which to start execution.
;; The call() method starts with a switch on this label number.

;; A basic block is represented by a case label (eg, "case 1001:") followed
;; by sequence of C# statements. Local jumps (within a codevector) are 
;; expressed as "goto case <label>".
