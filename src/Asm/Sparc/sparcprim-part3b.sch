; Check structure tag.
;
; RS1 has an object.  If the tag of RS1 is not 'tag1', or if the tag is 
; 'tag1' but the header byte of the object header is not 'tag2', then an
; exception with code 'excode' is signalled.  The exception call is set
; up to return to the first instruction of the emitted code.
;
; If RS1 is not RESULT then it is moved to RESULT before the exception 
; is signalled.
;
; If RS2/IMM is not #f, then it is a register or immediate that is moved
; to ARGREG2 before the exception is signalled; it is an immediate iff 
; imm? = #t.  
;
; RS1 must be a hardware register.
; RS2/IMM is a general register, ARGREG2, an immediate, or #f.
; RS3 is a general register, ARGREG3, or #f.
;
; The procedure returns the label of the fault address.  If the execution
; falls off the end of the emitted instruction sequence, then the following
; are true:
;  - the tag of the object in RS1 was 'tag1' and its header byte was 'tag2'
;  - the object header word is in TMP0.
