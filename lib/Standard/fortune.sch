; TXT format:
;   Each item is terminated by a line with only "%%" on it.
;
; DB format:
;   First item is a number: number of entries following.
;   Following items are lists of strings.  This is gross but works OK.
;
; BUG: Should check if dat file is writeable before trying to regenerate,
;      but no way to do that in Larceny right now (could catch exception).
;
; BUG: The seek code below is a crock.  Larceny needs seekable streams.
