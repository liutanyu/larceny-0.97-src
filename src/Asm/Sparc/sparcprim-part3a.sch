; LSH, RSHA, RSHL: Bitwise shifts on fixnums.
;
; Notes for future contemplation:
;   - The semantics do not match those of MIT Scheme or MacScheme: only 
;     positive shifts are allowed.
;   - The names do not match the fixnum-specific procedures of Chez Scheme
;     that have the same semantics: fxsll, fxsra, fxsrl.
;   - This code checks that the second argument is in range; if it did
;     not, then we could get a MOD for free.  Probably too hardware-dependent
;     to worry about.
;   - The range 0..31 for the shift count is curious given that the fixnum
;     is 30-bit.
