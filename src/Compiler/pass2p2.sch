; Second pass of the Twobit compiler, part 2:
;   single assignment elimination, assignment elimination,
;   and lambda lifting.
;
; See part 1 for further documentation.

; Single assignment elimination performs the transformation
;
;    (lambda (... I1 ... In ...)
;      (begin D ...)
;      (begin (set! I1 E1)
;             ...
;             (set! In En)
;             E ...))
; -> (lambda (... IGNORED ... IGNORED ...)
;      (let* ((I1 E1) ... (In En))
;        (begin D ...)
;        (begin E ...)))
;
; provided for each k:
;
;    1.  Ik does not occur in E1, ..., Ek.
;    2.  Either E1 through Ek contain no procedure calls
;        or Ik is not referenced by an escaping lambda expression.
;    3.  Ik is assigned only once.
;
; I doubt whether the third condition is really necessary, but
; dropping it would involve a more complex calculation of the
; revised referencing information.
;
; A more precise description of the transformation:
;
;    (lambda (... I1 ... In ...)
;      (begin (define F1 L1) ...)
;      (quote (... (I1 <references> ((set! I1 E1)) <calls>) ...
;                  (In <references> ((set! In En)) <calls>)
;                  (F1 <references> () <calls>) ...) ...)
;      (begin (set! I1 E1) ... (set! In En) E ...))
; -> (lambda (... IGNORED ... IGNORED ...)
;      (begin)
;      (quote (...) ...)
;      ((lambda (I1)
;         (begin)
;         (quote ((I1 <references> () <calls>)) ...)
;         ...
;           ((lambda (In)
;              (begin (define F1 L1) ...)
;              (quote (... (In <references> () <calls>)
;                          (F1 <references> () <calls>) ...) ...)
;              (begin E ...))
;            En)
;         ...)
;       E1))
;
; For best results, pass 1 should sort internal definitions and LETRECs
; so that procedure definitions/bindings come first, followed by
; definitions/bindings whose right hand side contains no calls,
; followed by definitions/bindings of variables that do not escape,
; followed by all other definitions/bindings.
;
; Pass 1 can't tell which variables escape, however.  Pass 2 can't tell
; which variables escape either until all enclosed lambda expressions
; have been simplified and the first transformation above has been
; performed.  That is why single assignment analysis precedes single
; assignment elimination.  As implemented here, an assignment that does
; not satisfy the conditions above will prevent the transformation from
; being applied to any subsequent assignments.
;
; This procedure operates by side effect.

; Lambda lifting raises internal definitions to outer scopes to avoid
; having to choose between creating a closure or losing tail recursion.
; If L is not #f, then L2 is a lambda expression nested within L.
; Any internal definitions that occur within L2 may be lifted to L
; by adding extra arguments to the defined procedure and to all calls to it.
; Lambda lifting is not a clear win, because the extra arguments could
; easily become more expensive than creating a closure and referring
; to the non-local arguments through the closure.  The heuristics used
; to decide whether to lift a group of internal definitions are isolated
; within the POLICY:LIFT? procedure.

; L2 can be the same as L, so the order of side effects is critical.
