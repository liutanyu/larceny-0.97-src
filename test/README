Partial test suite for Larceny.  See README files in each subdirectory
for more information.

These are of general interest:

Compiler  -- tests for the compiler and assemblers
FFI       -- foreign-function interface tests
GC        -- garbage collection benchmarks
Jaffer    -- R4RS conformance test
Lib       -- tests for the Scheme libraries
Misc      -- tests that don't have another home yet
Stress    -- stress tests (require Unix)


These are marginal and can be ignored:

Boot      -- for bootstrapping on a new system
Sparc     -- incomplete
