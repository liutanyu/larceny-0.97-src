Ah, I finally figured out the problem!  The linker had been giving me the
following warning:

ld: warning: i386 architecture of input file `pusha.o' is incompatible
with i386:x86-64 output

but I've written some fairly complex programs without any problems, so
I figured it didn't mean anything.  It turns out that this *is* a problem, =
and
for a few opcodes (like PUSHA and memory movements to/from EAX),
you need to pass the -melf_i386 to ld.  Why just these and not other
opcodes, I have no idea.

* Add note from Alex about chicken lo-mem compiling:
  Note, a tip for building Sassy for Chicken on machines with low
memory is to use the -split option (I used -split 8 on my 256MB RAM
laptop, didn't check if larger/smaller chunks would've been faster):

(compile sassy-chicken.scm -o sassy.so -s -O2 -d1 -split 8 -C -time -C -Os)


* PATCH 5 DOCS:

  * docs and tests for new special forms; lazy-macro and let-lazy-macro
  
  * docs for using include inside the macro expander

  * docs for new control macros from Alex

  * docs and tests for Alex's "units" subsystem.

* Ensure appropirate parts of srfi-69 and getenv are available in
  other schemes besides chicken/scheme48

* Add font-locking in sassy.el for let-macro let-lazy-macro	

* Add copyright, credits for Alex
